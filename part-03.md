# Avalanche Protocol Signature Exploit: Part Three

### ecdsa.SignCompact

For some reason, the link referenced here underneath this function points to: 

https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/9408498fd00555dd268e4987e5c89cd53ab9051f/dcrec/secp256k1/ecdsa/signature.go#L755-L780

However, that is not where the library is inherited from.

The library used in secp256k1r.go inherits from: 

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/dcrec/secp256k1/v3/ecdsa

points to V4 of the decred library.
  
The avalanche code uses the V3 version (this is stated correctly by the author)

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/dcrec/secp256k1/v3/ecdsa  

Going on, the author  strays away (Instead of linking to the github code of the V3 version, for a direct comparison).

Here is the relevan code of the decred V3 library, used in Avalanche:

### => ecdsa.SignCompact => signRFC6979 => secp256k1.NonceRFC6979
  
### => RFC6979 compliant nonce-generation exists
